## Installation
The GPdoemd package has been tested and validated on OSX and Ubuntu.  
No guarantees are provided that GPdoemd works on Windows-based systems.

##### Requirements
Python 3.4+
* numpy >= 1.7
* scipy >= 0.17
* [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy)

##### Creating a virtual environment
We recommend installing GPdoemd in a virtual environment.  
To set up a new virtual environment called myenv (example name), run the command
```
python3 -m venv myenv
```
in the folder where you want to store the virtual environment.  
After the virtual environment has been created, activate it as follows
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```
It is recommended that you update the pip installation in the virtual environment
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

##### Installing GPdoemd
First install all required packages. They are listed above and in the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/cog-imperial/GPdoemd/blob/master/requirements.txt).  
To install GPdoemd, run the following in the virtual environment
```
pip install git+https://github.com/cog-imperial/GPdoemd
```
It is also possible to clone into/download the GPdoemd git repository and install it using setup.py, but this is not recommended for most users.

##### Uninstalling GPdoemd
The GPdoemd package can be uninstalled by running
```
pip uninstall GPdoemd
```
Alternatively, the folder containing the virtual environment can be deleted.
